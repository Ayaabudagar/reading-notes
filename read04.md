# **javascript**
# *ACCESS CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to select any 
element, attribute, or text from an 
HTML page. For example: 
• Select the text inside all of the elements on a page 
• Select any elements that have a attribute with a value of note 
• Find out what was entered into a text input whose  attribute has a value 

# *MODIFY CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: 
• Add a paragraph of text after the first  element 
• Change the value of attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements 
• Change the size or position of an element 

# *PROGRAM RULES 
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), 
which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example: 
• A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display 
a larger version of that image. 
• A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a 
ca lculation, and display repayments. 
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom 
of the viewable area (also known as the viewport). 

# *REACT TO EVENTS 
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For 
example, it could be run when: 
• A button is pressed 
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on 
• A cursor hovers over an element 
• Information is added to a form 
• An interval of time has passed 
• A web page has finished loading

EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER 
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in 
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to: 
Access the content of the page 
Modify the content of the page 
Program rules or instructions the browser can follow 
React to events triggered by the user or browser

 *what is a scribt and how do i creat one ?*

A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

# **ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY
*EXPRESSIONS* 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking 
there are two types of expressions.
*OPERATORS*
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to 
create a single value from one or more values. 
*ARITHMETI C OPERATORS* 
JavaScript contains the following mathematical 
operators, which you can use with numbers. 
You may remember some from math class. 
*STRING OPERATOR* 
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. 
It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 

# *WHAT IS A FUNCTION?* 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

*A BASIC FUNCTION*
In this example, the user is 
shown a message at the top of 
the page. The message is held 
in an HTML element whose id 
attribute has a value of message. 
The message is going to be 
changed using JavaScript.  
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
Before the closing </body> 
tag, you can see the link to the 
JavaScript file. The JavaScript 
file starts with a variable used 
to hold a new message, and is 
followed by a function called 
updateMessage(). 
<ti t l e>Basic Function</title> 
<l i nk rel ="stylesheet" href="css/ c03.css" /> 
</head> 
<body> 
<hl>TravelWorthy</ hl> 
<div id="message">We lcome to our site! </ div> 
<script src="js/ basic-function .js"></script> 
</ body> 
</ html>

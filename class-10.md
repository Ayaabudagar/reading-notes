# Debugging and Error Handling
In software development, things are not as smooth as they may seem to the user. There are always errors and bugs that developers must deal with behind the scenes. As you might imagine, debugging and error tracing can be time-consuming, and the tools you use can make a huge difference in productivity.

If you’re using Vue.js, you’ve surely encountered various types of errors, and there’s usually more than one way to handle them. In this tutorial, we’ll review some best practices and demonstrate how to handle errors, set up a debugger, and trace errors efficiently in Vue.js.

**What is debugging?**
Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors and resolving bugs in software. It involves analyzing a problem, identifying its origin, determining the cause, and charting a course to resolve it as efficiently as possible.

**Debugging in Vue.js**
Vue.js provides a debugger that helps you handle errors and quickly address bugs in your application. VueJs Debugger is well-integrated with VSCode and both Chrome and Firefox.

First, download and install the Vue Debugger extension for Chrome or Firefox. You can read more on how to configure it in the Vue.js docs.

Once you’ve installed the debugger, go to VSCode Activity Bar and click the debugging icon. You’ll see a gear/settings icon. Click it and select your preferred browser.

Next, open the launch.json file and paste in the corresponding configuration based on the browser you selected.

Once the setup is complete, tracing errors is as easy as setting up several breakpoints in your application and running the debugger you just installed.

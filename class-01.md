# HTML Introduction

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 

HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2

What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


Before you can start adding content to your document, there's a basic structure you need to set up in your file. This structure isn't only required for your document to be compliant but will also allow you to provide useful information about your document. The basic structure of any HTML document consists of the following sections or elements:

The DTD (!DOCTYPE declaration).
The main container (html element).
The head section (head element).
The body section (body element).

EXTRA MARKUP
Specifying different versions of HTML
Identifying and grouping elements
Comments, meta information and iframes
At this point, we have covered the main tags that fit nicely into groups and sections.

In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are not easily grouped together. You will learn about:

The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using
How to add comments to your code
Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes
Elements that are used to group together parts of the page where no other element is suitable
How to embed a page within a page using iframes
How to add information about the web page using the <meta> element
Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols

HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter.


For me, steps to design a website requires 7 steps:

Goal identification: Where I work with the client to determine what goals the new website needs to fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is.
Scope definition: Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what web pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out.
Sitemap and wireframe creation: With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content and features we defined in scope definition will interrelate.
Content creation: Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the individual pages, always keeping search engine optimization (SEO) in mind to help keep pages focused on a single topic. It's vital that you have real content to work with for our next stage:
Visual elements: With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, moodboards, and element collages can help with this process.
Testing: By now, you've got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple broken links.
Launch: Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute your site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies â€” i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know? After that, it's time to break out the bubbly.

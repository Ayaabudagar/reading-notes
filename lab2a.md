 # What is a growth mindset?
> The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself “Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”

Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

* ### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset*
**1.Challenges**

When you faced with a challenging a problem, you have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until you conclude that it’s impossible or that you are incapable of solving it. I throw your ha
p. In other words, you are in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up. 

**2. Obstacles**

A coworker calls this “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.

**3. Effort**

So when you find yourself reaching for the snooze button, you consider all this. you make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset. you ask yourself, are going back to sleep really what you want to do? you are giving up too easily? Would you rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? C’mon, the answers are obvious.

**4. Criticism**

So you’ve learned to ask yourself two questions:

What was the best part of the day?
What went wrong, and how can you make sure it doesn’t happen again?
These questions help you focus on all aspects of your day, the good and the bad, and they help you internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.

And it turns out, variations of these questions help you process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), you can hold a mini-retrospective with :
Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?the aspects I’m less proud of
What can I do to improve ?
That’s the dark side of growth, I guess…

**5. Success of others**

It might not be possible to retrofit a company to have a similar level of openness and commitment to authenticity, but it’s not too hard to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions. We can choose to be more transparent or more helpful than might be required or than we’re used to. In other words, we can choose to go the extra mile, we can choose to be quick to praise and slow to criticize. We can choose to seek first to understand.

* ## Growing at work, and outside work too*
Maybe all this seems obvious to you, in which case, you’re lucky. For me, I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work. When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it..
